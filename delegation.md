# Delegation

### Non-User Delegation

When the person you want to delegate to is not a user of the site, you have the option to take a TEXT note of who you delegated the task to. If chosen by the user, email can be dispatched to the delegate informing them of the task with full project name, and task name, description, and due_date.

### User Delegation

When the person you want to delegate to is a user of the site, if you are 'friends' on the site a matching task without delegate_note will be automatically created for the other user and linked with the original task. When the delegated task is completed it will automatically mark the original task completed, and if the delegated task is rejected/deleted the original task will be returned to the original user's inbox w/ reason


### deferred date behavior

On the deferred date/time the task will be added to review views for check-up.
